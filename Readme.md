# Financial Goal Tracker Platform Documentation

## **Project Overview**
The Financial Goal Tracker platform is a web application designed to help users set financial goals, save money, track their progress, and access educational resources on personal finance. Users can save for specific goals (e.g., an emergency fund) and withdraw the funds upon meeting the goal. Upon goal completion, users gain access to educational content aimed at improving their financial literacy.

## **Core Features**

### 1. **User Authentication**
- **Sign-Up and Login System**:
  - Secure user registration and login using email and password.
  - Passwords are encrypted for security.
- **Authentication Options**:
  - **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication for API requests.
  - **Forgot Password**: Option for users to reset their password via email.

### 2. **Goal Creation**
- Users can create financial goals with the following details:
  - Goal Name (e.g., "Emergency Fund")
  - Target Amount (e.g., $500)
  - Time Frame (e.g., 3 months)
- Goals are visually displayed for easy tracking.

### 3. **Saving Money**
- **Deposits**:
  - Users can simulate deposits toward their goal using a mock payment system.
  - Each deposit updates the progress toward the goal.
- **Progress Tracking**:
  - Visual representation of savings progress (e.g., progress bar, percentage, or graph).
  - Notifications when milestones are reached (e.g., "50% of your goal achieved!").

### 4. **Withdrawal System**
- **Eligibility**:
  - Users can request to withdraw funds only after the goal is met.
- **Request Process**:
  - Users submit a withdrawal request.
  - The platform approves the request and processes the simulated withdrawal.

### 5. **Financial Education**

- **Topics Covered**:
  - Budgeting and Expense Tracking
  - Savings Strategies
  - Basics of Investing
  - Understanding Credit and Debt

   - Deposits update the goal’s progress bar or chart.

4. **Achieve Goal**:
   - When the target amount is reached, users are notified.
   - A withdrawal option is enabled.

5. **Withdraw Funds**:
